## Rules
- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word
- The colour of a tile will change to show you how close your guess was
- If the tile turns white, the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot
- If the tile turns purple, the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot
- If the tile stays grey, the letter is not in the word
- Each player gets 5 tries to guess the correct Northwestern themed word!
